Requirements.
  qt4.8.1 or higher. tested on 4.8.1 and 4.8.3. Might work on earlier versions, need testing.
  qtsolutions: as of 10/29/2012, this can be found at http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-solutions
    This is a source only library. No building and installing.
  QSerialDevice: as of 10/29/2012, this can be found at http://qt.gitorious.org/qtplayground/qtserialport
    I believe Qt5 will include QSerialDevice by default. For Qt4 it must be built and installed.
    I needed libudev-dev to build QSerialDevice.
    
SpaceMeld building:
  qmake SpaceMeldDaemon.pro "SOLUTIONS_ROOT = path to the root directory of qt-solutions"
    i.e.   qmake SpaceMeldDaemon.pro "SOLUTIONS_ROOT = /home/user/development/qt-solutions"
  make or nmake
  qmake SpaceMeldController.pro "SOLUTIONS_ROOT = path to the root directory of qt-solutions"
  make or nmake
  //haven't done install on anything yet.
  
Known limitations and bugs.
  Couldn't generate key strokes on windows for button mapping.
  Only Serial devices at ths point.

  Kubuntu 12.04 amd64 and 12.10 amd64.
  windows 7 amd64.
